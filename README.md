## What is this 

This is the site I plan on writing up projects I have worked on 

## Why is this 

So I can have a better understanding of what I've done by explaining it 

(And so I can remember)

## What's the plan 

1. Have all the writeups be markdown files 
2. Use nextjs mdx to read and convert the markdown files into static pages 
3. Have a generic styling that is applied to the markdown pages
4. Auto-re-build the image when new pushes are made

## Todo 

- Move to k8 mesh 
- Move layout into appjs? 
- Add links back to meyersa.com/socials 
- Utilize asset server
- Move hardcoded values, eg author, to env or const file
